Attendees will construct a folding bench to take home with them upon completion. Enjoy the making process, be proud of your creation, plus get comfortable on woodworking equipment. This course is designed to be accessible to the novice but also fun for those with moderate woodworking experience.
All levels of experience are welcome. Open to ages 8 and up, although children should be accompanied by an
adult.
Instructor: Kelly McDonald. Kelly is a maker with a variety of interest - including woodworking, electronics projects and programming - sometimes combining all three into one project! Among his favorite woodworking projects that he’s built are a bookcase with hand-cut dovetails patterned after one at Monticello."

    desc: "This skills-focused Laser Cutting course is designed to take attendees from novice to laser-ready for designing and
making laser cut projects. You’ll leave with open source software for designing, editing, and “printing” laser-cut items, along with your own laser-cut sample project to take home. Laser cut designs are limited to a 5 by 5 design in wood or plexiglass (with both etching and cutting capabilities) and are available to pick up after class. We encourage but (don’t require!) you to bring your own laptop.
All levels of experience are welcome. Open to ages 7 and up, although children should be accompanied by an adult.
Instructor: Andy Wiseman. Andy teaches many “Make It & Take It” makerspace workshops, introducing students to new equipment and helping them begin their own journeys to prototyping, constructing, innovating and more."
