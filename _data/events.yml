    desc: "This skill building course will introduce you to a CNC routing machine, a software-controlled carving tool that can
be used to make precise inlays, 3D carvings, and more. Focusing on Easel, a simple and free software program that makes cutting very straight forward, we’ll cover the basics needed to use this computer-controlled router to carve projects in plastic and wood. Together, we will design and cut a custom inlay for a jewelry box. We will cover many of the basics applicable to all CNC based machines. We recommend, but do not require, that you bring a laptop.
All levels of experience are welcome. Open to ages 7 and up, although children should be accompanied by an adult.

This workshop is part of an evolving series to train makers on powerful, open source software that underlies many of our making tools and equipment. Inkscape is a vector graphics application used for illustrations, diagrams, line art, logos and more, creating images that can be used online, artistically, or for laser cutting and wood etching. The workshop will provide an overview of the software itself, its most powerful features, and live feedback and assistance as participants explore creating their own design and images. You'll leave with the latest version of Inkscape, plus the confidence to design, create, and play with this graphics design and image-creating tool. Attendees are encouraged by not required to bring their own laptop (please try and install Inkscape before you come, it's free!).

      By using MakersCAD users are not only learning 3D modeling but computer programming as well. MakerSCAD modular design makes it perfect for beginners but it also contains unlimited possibilities with its advanced JavaSrcript interface for experienced users.
      Please note: MakerSCAD is shifting to a pay what you can model for their software, in which they are looking for everyone to have access to MakerSCAD. The workshop itself is free, and attendees will be able to download Makerscad and pay whatever they want (including $0.00) for the software.

On Saturday, June 10 we're excited to host their Build Your Own 3D Printer workshop, described by them here: Build your own 3D Printer in just one day! Now, for the first time in the Shenandoah Valley, we are pleased to announce that we are hosting a One Day 3D Printer build!  Building your 3D printer is by far the best way to take ownership of the technology and to really get to understand it. You will be in a complete control, and able fix it when it breaks. You lose any inhibition or feelings of awe. You will be in charge. In just one day, you will build the award winning, made-for-education JellyBox 3D printer from the ground up, learn about it from the inside out and begin printing with it. You can even bring a friend, a kid, a spouse or even a first date."
